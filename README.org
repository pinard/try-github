** org-odt.el Bugs and Pending Items
*** TODO Links to Listified Headlines are not generated
    Export this documen with H:3 and note that link references under
    [[References]] are broken. To circumvent this issue change default
    settings from H:3 to H:4 for now.
*** TODO Cleanup on crash
    When odt exporter throws an error the xml files are content.xml,
    styles.xml etc are left staying around. Need to clean these up
    using unwind-protect?
*** TODO Fix all interactive commands

    See [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2011-01/msg01293.html][this post]].

    - Fix cross references to Tables, Images etc. Ability to choose
      other types names, like Chart, Figure, etc.
    - Paragraphs were frequently split up, mid-sentence, by unwanted
      paragraph breaks. Not sure whether this problem still exists
      with the latest release of org-odt.

**** TODO Broken link within [[References to Dedicated Target]]

*** TODO Support for MathML
    [2011-03-29 Tue]
    MathToWeb could be used for this. See [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2011-03/msg01755.html][following post]].

    This section introduces two issues.
    - A text:span element cannot occur within text:bookmark-ref. How
      to handle this.
    - text:style-name attribute for text:section cannot have
      spaces. Explore styling of section in OpenOffice.

*** TODO Tables within a list-item				   :noexport:
    Tables cannot occur as list-item. OpenOffice Writer seems to
    handle this scenario as follows: While encountering a table
    terminate the top-level list. Insert formatted Table with the same
    indentation as if it were a list-item of the original list. Once
    the table is inserted, re-open the list and start emitting the
    following list-items at the right nested level.

    Fixing this bug would require that the list callbacks provide
    information on the indentation level of the current list. Not sure
    how to set the Table indentation properties?

** About Orgmode
   Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
   project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

   Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
   lists or information about projects as plain text. Org is
   implemented on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep
   the content of large files well structured. Visibility cycling and
   structure editing help to work with the tree. Tables are easily
   created with a built-in table editor. Org supports TODO items,
   deadlines, timestamps, and scheduling. It dynamically compiles
   entries into an agenda that utilizes and smoothly integrates much of
   the Emacs calendar and diary. Plain text URL-like links connect to
   websites, emails, Usenet messages, BBDB entries, and any files
   related to the projects. For printing and sharing of notes, an Org
   file can be exported as a structured ASCII file, as HTML, or (TODO
   and agenda items only) as an iCalendar file. It can also serve as a
   publishing tool for a set of linked web pages.

   As a project planning environment, Org works by adding metadata to
   outline nodes. Based on this data, specific entries can be extracted
   in queries and create dynamic agenda views.

   Org mode contains the Org Babel environment which allows you to work
   with embedded source code blocks in a file, to facilitate code
   evaluation, documentation, and tangling.

   Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
   capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
   minor Orgtbl mode. Using a translation step, it can be used to
   maintain tables in arbitrary file types, for example in LaTeX. The
   structure editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside
   Org with the minor Orgstruct mode.

   Org keeps simple things simple. When first fired up, it should feel
   like a straightforward, easy to use outliner. Complexity is not
   imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you
   need it. Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways and for
   different ends, for example:

   -  an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
   -  an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes
   -  a TODO list editor
   -  a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
   -  an environment in which to implement David Allen's GTD system
   -  a simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export
   -  a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked webpages
   -  an environment for literate programming
